# TSID Project

This is the repository to test my personal project for the PhD course *Optimization-Based Control of Legged Robot* held by prof. [Andrea Del Prete](https://github.com/andreadelprete).

This project collects my [ROS2 implementation](https://github.com/idra-lab/tsid_controller) of the [Task Space Inverse Dynamics](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid) library. Tests are conducted on the [Unitree Z1](https://github.com/idra-lab/z1_ros2) mobile manipulator whose ROS2 porting has been developed by myself.
